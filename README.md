Just getting started... PROVE me wrong!

80% of every paycheck IS TAXED, your take home is ~20%

## Heavy hitters

- Federal income tax 15 to 25% for middle class effective rate
- FICA - 15.3% 
- State/local income tax - 6-12% 
- Property taxes - $5,000 to $10,000 (and rapidly climbing) - 1 to 1.2% of home value (increasingly suffocating with housing market)
- Sales tax - 8 to 12% very common
  - NOTE: poor people (and middleclass) regularly pay tens of millions to millionaires to build stadiums... stadiums 90% will never step foot in...

## Middle of the road

- Car registration/taxes - 750$ a year (per car)
- Gas taxes - ~500 a year per family ... TODO get actual gallons averages and then $0.55/gallon in federal/state taxes usually

## Utility bills

- Cell phone - ~500$ annually (TODO get actuals from my bill)
- Electric bill 
- Gas bill
- Internet bill
- Landline - massive taxes here


## Easily missed

- Sell something used? Pay income tax again
  - TODO estimate how much an average person resells and thus pays in a triple tax now (income tax, sales tax, income tax, oh and buyer pays sales tax again too!)
